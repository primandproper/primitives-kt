/**
 * Configures retry behavior — the analog of platform-go's `retry.Config`. An immutable data class
 * built with named arguments (`RetryConfig(maxAttempts = 5)`) rather than ozzo-validation's struct
 * tags, since there is no env/JSON loader on Android to target: defaults come from the constructor's
 * default arguments and the config is validated at construction in [init] (the analog of
 * `Config.ValidateWithContext`), so an invalid policy fails loudly at build time rather than being
 * silently clamped.
 *
 * [retryIf] extends platform-go's model: Go marks a single error non-retryable by wrapping it with
 * `Unretryable`; this adds an optional blanket predicate so a whole class of exceptions can be
 * excluded without wrapping each one. It defaults to "always retryable", which reproduces Go's
 * behavior exactly when left untouched.
