/**
 * Thrown (or passed to [unretryable]) to mark an exception as one a [Policy] must not retry — the
 * analog of platform-go's `ErrUnretryable`/`Unretryable`. The original exception is preserved as
 * [Throwable.cause], so `cause` chains and `is`/`as` checks against it still work.
 *
 * Unlike Go, where retrying is opt-out per error via wrapping, [CancellationException] is *always*
 * terminal regardless of this type — cancellation must never be swallowed by a retry loop.
