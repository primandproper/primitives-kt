/**
 * Computes the exponential-backoff-with-jitter delay sequence, shared by [ExponentialBackoffPolicy]
 * and [retryWithPolicy]. Stateful: each [next] call returns the delay to sleep for the current
 * attempt and advances to the next one, mirroring the `delay` variable threaded through
 * platform-go's `Execute` loop.
 *
 * Because that state escalates and never resets, one instance corresponds to exactly one retry
 * sequence: callers construct a fresh [Backoff] at the start of each `execute()` invocation / Flow
 * collection rather than sharing it on a long-lived object, so the mutation here is never contended.
