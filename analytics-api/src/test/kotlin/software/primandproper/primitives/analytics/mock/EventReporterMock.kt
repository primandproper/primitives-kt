/**
 * A configurable [EventReporter] test double, mirroring platform-go's moq-generated
 * `analyticsmock.EventReporterMock`. Each method delegates to a settable `...Func`; calling a method
 * whose `Func` was left `null` throws [IllegalStateException] — the same "unmocked call surfaces
 * immediately" behavior moq's generated panic gives. Every call's arguments are recorded in the
 * matching `...Calls` list, standing in for moq's generated `XCalls()` accessors.
 *
 * ```
 * val mock = EventReporterMock(eventOccurredFunc = { event, userID, props -> /* assert */ })
 * ```
