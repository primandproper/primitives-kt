 * Collects data about customers — the port of platform-go's `analytics.EventReporter`.

 * The Go interface threads a `context.Context` through every method and returns an `error`; the
 * coroutine-native Kotlin analog drops the explicit context (trace context rides the coroutine
 * scope, installed by the Observer span) and signals failure by throwing rather than returning an
 * error value. Delivery-oriented methods are therefore `suspend`, so a backend can await its
 * circuit breaker / transport without blocking a thread.
