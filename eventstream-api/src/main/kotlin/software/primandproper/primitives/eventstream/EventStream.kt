/**
 * A unidirectional, server-to-client event stream. Port of platform-go's `eventstream.EventStream`.
 *
 * The Go interface is `Send(ctx, *Event) error`, `Done() <-chan struct{}`, `Close() error`. This
 * port keeps the same three operations but expresses them in coroutine terms:
 *
 * - `Send` becomes a `suspend fun` [send] — the coroutine that emits carries the cancellation and
 *   (via the observability `span { }`) the trace context that Go threaded through `ctx`.
 * - `Done() <-chan struct{}` becomes a read-only [done] [Job]: a caller awaits stream termination
 *   with `done.join()`, the coroutine analog of `<-stream.Done()`, and the [Job] completes exactly
 *   when the channel would have closed.
 * - `Close` becomes a `suspend fun` [close] because the real WebSocket teardown suspends.
 *
 * The direction matters: the SERVER (`:eventstream-ktor`) implements this to *emit* over SSE or a
 * WebSocket; the CLIENT (`:eventstream-android`) never implements it — it *consumes* the same events
 * as a `Flow<Event>`, the mirror image of this contract.
