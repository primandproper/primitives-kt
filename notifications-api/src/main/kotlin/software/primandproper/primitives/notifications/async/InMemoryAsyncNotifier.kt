/**
 * An in-process [AsyncNotifier] with deterministic, retrying delivery — the local backend that stands
 * in for platform-go's networked async backends (WebSocket/SSE/Pusher/Ably), which need a live
 * transport and are documented seams here.
 *
 * DELIVERY ORDERING: [publish] delivers an event to a channel's subscribers **synchronously, in
 * registration order**, and suspends until every subscriber has been handled. Because a single
 * publisher's calls run to completion one after another, the events a given subscriber sees preserve
 * the publish order — the ordering guarantee the WebSocket/SSE backends provide over a single
 * connection.
 *
 * RETRY: a subscriber handler that throws is retried up to [maxAttempts] times (with an optional
 * [retryDelay] between attempts). A transient failure that later succeeds is delivered exactly once
 * overall; if a subscriber exhausts its attempts the failure is recorded on the span and rethrown, so
 * [publish] fails fast rather than silently dropping. A [CancellationException] propagates immediately
 * and is never retried, so a cancelled coroutine tears down cleanly.
 *
 * Every [publish] opens an Observer span recording the channel, event type, and subscriber count,
 * matching the instrumentation convention of the other backends.
