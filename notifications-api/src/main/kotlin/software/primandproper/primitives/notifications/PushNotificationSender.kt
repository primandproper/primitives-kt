 * for [Platform.ANDROID] — and delivers to a device token or a subscription topic. Go's methods thread
 * a `context.Context` and return an `error`; this port suspends instead (cancellation and trace context
 * ride the coroutine context) and signals failure by throwing, the idiomatic Kotlin shape.
 *
 * Backends live in sibling modules (`:notifications-fcm`); the noop and mock doubles ship here. The
 * inbound RECEIVE side — an Android app reacting to a delivered push — is the direction-flipped
 * `:notifications-android` module (port of Go's `mobile` package as consumed on-device).
