/**
 * The standard observability attribute keys for push notifications, so a value is named identically
 * wherever it is recorded across backends. Port of the notification-relevant keys platform-go's
 * senders set on their operations (`op.Set("platform", …)`, `op.Set("title", …)`,
 * `op.Set("fcm.message_id", …)`).
 *
 * REDACTION: platform-go's FCM/APNs senders never put the device token on a span — they record the
 * title, the platform, and the provider-assigned message id, but not the credential-bearing token —
 * so this port carries the same behavior: there is no `token` key here and backends do not record it.
 * The Bearer auth header a backend sends is likewise redacted by `:httpclient-api`'s HeaderRedaction
 * before any request data reaches a span.
