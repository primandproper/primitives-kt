/**
 * The supported storage providers. Port of platform-go's `objectstorage` provider constants
 * (`FilesystemProvider`, `MemoryProvider`, `S3Provider`, …). [value] is the wire/string form validated
 * against configuration.
 *
 * [MEMORY] and [FILESYSTEM] are served by the buckets in this module; [S3] is served by `:uploads-s3`;
 * [GCP], [R2], and [BACKBLAZE_B2] are documented seams (`TODO(gcs)` / `TODO(r2)` / `TODO(b2)`) — the
 * enum lists them so config validation accepts them, but no backend is wired here yet.
