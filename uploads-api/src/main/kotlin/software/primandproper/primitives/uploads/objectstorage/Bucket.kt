/**
 * The low-level, provider-specific storage surface — the analog of gocloud.dev's `blob.Bucket`. A
 * [Uploader] wraps one and owns all instrumentation (spans, and the `TODO(metrics)`/`TODO(circuitbreaking)`
 * seams), so each backend implements only the raw operations and stays free of observability wiring.
 *
 * This is the seam the S3 backend plugs into: `:uploads-s3` supplies an `S3Bucket` and reuses the same
 * [Uploader], exactly as platform-go instruments a single `Uploader` over whichever `blob.Bucket`
 * `selectBucket` opened. In-tree implementations are [MemoryBucket] and [FilesystemBucket].
 *
 * All methods suspend; backends that call blocking or future-returning clients bridge to coroutines
 * themselves (`Dispatchers.IO`, `CompletableFuture.await()`).
