/**
 * Generates QR codes for TOTP two-factor-authentication setup. Port of platform-go's `qrcodes.Builder`.
 *
 * [buildQrCode] renders the authenticator `otpauth://totp/...` URI for a username/secret pair into a
 * QR-code PNG and returns it as a base64 `data:image/png;base64,...` URI — the form an authenticator
 * app scans and a web or Android client drops straight into an image source. Go threads a
 * `context.Context`; this port suspends instead, so trace context propagates through the coroutine.
 *
 * It is an interface so the noop double (see the `noop` package) and unit tests can substitute a
 * builder without driving a live ZXing encoder.
