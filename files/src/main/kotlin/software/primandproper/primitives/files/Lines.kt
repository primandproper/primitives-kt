/*
 * files — ergonomic helpers for reading text files line by line or in fixed-size chunks, a port of
 * platform-go's `files` package (its reading core).
 *
 * `lines` and `chunks` are lazy Sequences over any java.io.Reader; the caller owns the Reader's
 * lifecycle. `sliceLines` reads no further than it needs to. Kotlin's stdlib already covers the
 * simplest cases (Reader.readLines / Reader.useLines / Path.useLines); the helpers here add
 * Go-faithful line splitting — only '\n' terminates a line, and a single '\r' immediately before it
 * is stripped, so a lone '\r' in the middle of a line is preserved rather than treated as a break —
 * plus fixed-size chunking and windowed slicing that report the sentinel errors in FilesException.
