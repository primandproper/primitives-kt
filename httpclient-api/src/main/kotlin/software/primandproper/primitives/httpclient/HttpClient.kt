/**
 * The traced HTTP client contract — the keystone every networked package (`llm`, `embeddings`,
 * `uploads`, …) calls through. Coroutine-native: [execute] is a `suspend` function, so a call made
 * inside an observability `span { }` inherits that span from the coroutine context and the backend's
 * OpenTelemetry instrumentation parents its request span underneath it. When tracing is absent the
 * call still runs — it just produces no span (see each backend's noop degradation).
 *
 * It is an interface so tests substitute [FakeHttpClient] and DI can swap the OkHttp (client/Android)
 * backend for the Ktor (server) one without touching call sites — the same seam `Observer` gives
 * observability.
