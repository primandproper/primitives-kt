/**
 * Configures a backend HTTP client. Port of platform-go's `httpclient.Config`, with two Kotlin-native
 * additions: [connectTimeout] (Go folds this into the dialer timeout) and the [retryHook] seam.
 *
 * Immutable: defaults are supplied by the constructor's default arguments (with the timeouts using a
 * `null` sentinel resolved on read by [timeout]/[connectTimeout], since `connectTimeout` falls back to
 * the resolved `timeout`), and the config is validated at construction in [init] rather than in a
 * separate `EnsureDefaults`/`ValidateWithContext` phase.
 *
 * Build one with named arguments: `HttpClientConfig(timeout = 5.seconds)`.
 *
 * @param timeout whole-call timeout; `null` (the default) resolves to [DEFAULT_TIMEOUT].
 * @param connectTimeout connection-establishment timeout; `null` (the default) resolves to [timeout].
 * @param enableTracing whether the backend installs its OpenTelemetry instrumentation so calls join
 *   the trace and inject `traceparent`. `null` (the default) means "auto": the client factories enable
 *   tracing when a real (non-noop) `OpenTelemetry` is supplied, and leave it off for the noop default.
 *   Set it explicitly to force tracing on or off regardless of the supplied `OpenTelemetry`.
 * @param retryHook optional retry seam. `null` (the default) means one attempt, no retries. The real
 *   backoff/jitter policy is the separately-ported `retry` package — wire an implementation in here
 *   rather than baking a policy into the client. See [executeWithRetries].
