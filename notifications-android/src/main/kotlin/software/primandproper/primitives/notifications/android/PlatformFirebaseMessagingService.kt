/**
 * The concrete [FirebaseMessagingService] the OS instantiates when a push is delivered — the
 * `TODO(fcm-android)` seam, now wired. It is the ONLY class in this module that touches a
 * `com.google.firebase` type: it copies the delivered [RemoteMessage] into the Firebase-free
 * [RawPushPayload] and hands it to a [PushMessageDispatcher] built from the app's registered
 * [PushMessageHandler] (see [PlatformFirebaseMessaging]). All mapping/dispatch logic lives behind that
 * seam in JVM-unit-tested code; this class is the thin, untestable-off-device adapter.
 *
 * Registered in this module's merged manifest, so a consuming app gets it automatically — it need only
 * supply `google-services.json` and register a handler. With no handler registered, a delivered push
 * is dropped (no crash).
 *
 * `open` so an app can subclass to customize (e.g. override [onNewToken] to persist the token) while
 * reusing the receive path.
