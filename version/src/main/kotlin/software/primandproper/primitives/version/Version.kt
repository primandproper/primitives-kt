/*
Port of platform-go's `version` package: a holder for build/VCS metadata with an "unknown" fallback
for any unset field, plus indented-JSON rendering for CLI use.

Injection seam: platform-go sets package-level vars (`Version`, `CommitHash`, …) via `-ldflags -X`
at link time. The JVM has no linker seam, so this module ships only the holder ([BuildInfo]) and the
unknown-fallback accessor ([get]). Filling the holder is left as a documented build-time seam — the
consumer wires a Gradle task to write a generated resource (or stamp the JAR manifest) and populates
[BuildInfo] at startup, e.g. `BuildInfo.version = readManifestAttribute("Implementation-Version")`.
Left unset, every field falls back to "unknown", which is a valid shipping state.
