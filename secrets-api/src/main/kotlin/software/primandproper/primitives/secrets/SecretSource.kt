/**
 * Provides read access to secrets by name. Port of platform-go's `secrets.SecretSource`.
 *
 * Go returns `(string, error)`; the network-backed backends (GCP, SSM, kubectl) genuinely do I/O, so
 * the retrieval is modelled as a `suspend` function here — the same coroutine-native choice
 * `httpclient`'s `HttpClient.execute` makes — while the in-process backends ([env] and the Android
 * keystore store) simply never suspend.
 *
 * ## Secret values are never observed
 * Implementations MUST NOT record a secret's *value* on a span or in a log line — only the lookup
 * *key* may be observed. This is the secrets analog of `httpclient`'s header redaction: the guarantee
 * is enforced by never handing the value to the observability pillars in the first place. See the
 * `NOTE` in [software.primandproper.primitives.secrets.env.EnvSecretSource].
