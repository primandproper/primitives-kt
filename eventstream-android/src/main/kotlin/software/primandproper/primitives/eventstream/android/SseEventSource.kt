 *
 * OkHttp's `okhttp-sse` does the SSE framing (reassembling multi-line `data:` blocks, dispatching one
 * callback per event); each callback becomes an [Event] whose [Event.type] is the SSE `event:` field
 * and whose [Event.payload] is the reassembled `data` — the exact inverse of what the server wrote in
 * `sseStream.Send`. The flow completes when the server closes the stream and fails (propagating the
 * cause) on a transport error; cancelling the collector cancels the underlying [EventSource.cancel].
 *
 * An optional [observer] is notified when an event is dropped under backpressure (a burst larger than
 * the flow's buffer would otherwise vanish silently); it defaults to [NoopEventStreamObserver].

     *
     * TODO(reconnect): add a reconnecting variant that wraps this in `:retry`'s `Flow.retryWithPolicy`
     *  and, on each re-collection, re-issues [request] with the last observed [SseMessage.id] as the
     *  `Last-Event-ID` header so the server replays from where the stream dropped. It is left out of
