/**
 * An on-device [EventReporter] that buffers events in memory rather than delivering them to a vendor
 * — the local Android backend, and an offline / pre-write-key stand-in for the network-backed
 * [SegmentEventReporter] (both implement the same interface, so callers swap without changing code).
 *
 * The buffer is bounded ([capacity]) and thread-safe: when full, the oldest event is dropped so a
 * burst can never exhaust memory. Every public operation opens an Observer span recording the
 * user/event/length, matching how the other reporters instrument. Once [close]d, further events are
 * ignored.
 *
 * ## The buffer is in-memory and process-local — NOT durable
 * Events live only in this instance's heap. There is no disk persistence: if the process is killed
 * (backgrounded and reclaimed, crash, reboot) before a consumer [drain]s and forwards them, the
 * buffered events are lost. A consumer flushes the buffer with [drain] and forwards the events to the
 * real transport, or inspects it non-destructively with [snapshot]; scheduling that drain (e.g. from a
 * `WorkManager` job) does not by itself make the events survive process death.
 *
 * TODO(persist-buffer): back the buffer with durable storage so events outlive the process. Intended
 * shape: persist each captured [BufferedEvent] to Jetpack DataStore (or a Room table) on
 * [record] instead of (or alongside) the in-memory deque, and run a `WorkManager` `CoroutineWorker`
 * that reads the persisted rows, forwards them to the real transport, and deletes the drained rows on
 * success. Only then does the "flush from a WorkManager job" story actually survive process death.
