/*
Port of platform-go's `bitmask` package: an immutable bitmask with set-algebra operations. Every
operation returns a new Bitmask, leaving the receiver untouched.

Overlap with the standard library: the JDK already offers `java.util.EnumSet` (a fast set over enum
constants) and raw `Long` bit twiddling covers most of what this does. This port is preferred where
faithfulness to platform-go matters — it keeps the exact `Set`/`Clear`/`Has`/`Union`/… surface, the
width-aware zero-padded `toString`, and value semantics — so code reads the same across the Go and
Kotlin sides. Reach for `EnumSet` instead when you want an idiomatic Kotlin/Java set and don't need
the shared API or the packed integer representation (e.g. persistence, wire formats).

Divergence from Go: `Bitmask[T Unsigned]` is generic over the four fixed-width unsigned types. Kotlin
cannot constrain a type parameter to its unsigned types and run bit operations on it generically, so
the width the type parameter carried in Go — used for `toString` padding and range-checked parsing —
becomes an explicit `width` (8, 16, 32, or 64 bits) over a single `ULong` backing value, which is
masked to that width on construction. Go's `MarshalJSON`/`UnmarshalJSON` (bare-number encoding) are
ported as [toJsonNumber] / [Companion.parseJsonNumber] rather than a serialization-framework hook, so
the module stays stdlib-only; the semantics — decimal number in, width range-checked on the way back
— are preserved.
