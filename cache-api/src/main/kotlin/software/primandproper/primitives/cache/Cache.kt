package software.primandproper.primitives.cache

/**
 * A generic cache. Port of platform-go's `cache.Cache[T]`.
 *
 * Go's `Get` returns `(*T, error)`, signalling a miss with the exported sentinel `cache.ErrNotFound`.
 * Kotlin has no `(value, error)` split, and returning a nullable value is the idiomatic miss signal,
 * so [get] returns `T?` where `null` means "not in the cache". The [CacheNotFoundException] sentinel
 * is still provided for callers who prefer the exception form (see [getOrThrow]).
 *
 * [T] is bound to `Any` so `T?` unambiguously distinguishes a stored value from a miss, mirroring how
 * Go stores `*T` and treats a nil pointer as absence.
 *
 * Serialization stays at the boundary, exactly as in Go: the in-memory backend holds live `T` values,
 * while a server backend (`:cache-redis`) takes a codec to turn `T` into its stored bytes.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `close()` here (unlike the platform's other lifecycle interfaces, which
 * share `SuspendCloseable`): a `Cache` does not own its backing client's lifecycle. The injected
 * `RedisClient` / store is owned by whoever constructed it, so there is nothing for the cache
 * abstraction itself to close.
