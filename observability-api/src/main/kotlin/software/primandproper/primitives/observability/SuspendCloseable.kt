/**
 * The platform-wide teardown contract for a resource whose `close()` genuinely does I/O — a network
 * flush, a WebSocket goodbye frame, a connection-pool drain. It is the `suspend` sibling of
 * [kotlin.AutoCloseable]: an interface for which `close()` is a `suspend fun`, so it may await its
 * transport without blocking a thread, and so callers can bracket it with the [use] extension below
 * exactly as they would an `AutoCloseable`.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in observability-api
 * There is no dedicated "core" module in platform-kt; `observability-api` is the de-facto shared
 * spine — a near-leaf that every service module already depends on (each opens an `Observer` span).
 * It already models a lifecycle here ([Operation.makeCurrent] hands back an `AutoCloseable` a caller
 * brackets), so the suspend analog is at home alongside it. Putting the type here means the I/O-backed
 * lifecycle interfaces (`SecretSource`, `EventReporter`, `HttpClient`, `AsyncNotifier`, messagequeue's
 * `Publisher`/`Consumer`/providers, `Locker`, `EventStream`) share ONE closer type without any of them
 * taking a new dependency they didn't already have.
 *
 * Genuinely synchronous, in-memory lifecycles (`RateLimiter`, `FeatureFlagManager`, `DatabaseClient`)
 * stay on [kotlin.AutoCloseable] — their `close()` does no I/O and need not suspend.
