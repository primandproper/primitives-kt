/**
 * A scriptable, recording [CircuitBreaker] test double — the idiomatic-Kotlin analog of the
 * moq-generated `circuitbreaking/mock.CircuitBreakerMock`. Where the Go mock lets a test supply a
 * closure per method and inspect the recorded call lists, this records call counts and lets a test
 * force the outcome via [reject].
 *
 * With `reject = true` every [execute] throws [CircuitBrokenException] without running the block (a breaker
 * pinned open), which is how the partitioned tests assert per-key isolation. With the default
 * `reject = false` it passes calls through, counting successes and failures so a test can assert how
 * a collaborator exercised the breaker.
