 * Thrown when a breaker rejects a call because it is open (or exhausting its half-open probe budget).
 * platform-go declares this as `circuitbreaking.ErrCircuitBroken`.
 *
 * The class is *owned by* `:errors` ([software.primandproper.primitives.errors.CircuitBrokenException])
 * because that module's HTTP/gRPC mappers match it by type, and `:circuitbreaking` depends on
 * `:errors` (owning it here would create a dependency cycle). We re-export the exact same class, so a
 * rejection thrown here is matched by `isError<CircuitBrokenException>(e)` and the `:errors` mappers
 * resolve it to HTTP 503 / the right gRPC code. Thrown fresh at each rejection (never a shared
 * singleton), so every rejection carries its own stack trace.
